This repository contains a SDSoC Project which includes an implementation of a 3-layered artificial neural network (testphase only). It can be build for Xilinx Zynq FPGA. A SDCard image for the ZC706 evaluation board is included, containing the implementation and a petalinux build. This project is part of a bachelor thesis in applied computer science. The thesis is included aswell but it is written in the german language.
